Problem Statement:
Read the text file `sowpods.txt` and PRINT
every word that contains ALL FIVE vowels

The order of the vowels does NOT matter, and
the check should be case-insensitive.

education
sequoia
facetious
hello
audio
unequivocal

Output Example:
education
sequoia
facetious
unequivocal
Total words with all vowels: 4

Explanation:
- "education" contains a, e, i, o, u -> yes
